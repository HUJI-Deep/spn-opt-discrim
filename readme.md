**Adaptation of "Parameter Learning of Sum-Product Networks" for learning models for missing data classification**

This contains the [original code](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hzhao1/papers/ICML2016/spn_release.zip) implementing the methods described in:
- **A Unified Approach for Learning the Parameters of Sum-Product Networks**
by H. Zhao, P. Poupart and G. Gordon, NIPS 2016.
- **Collapsed Variational Inference for Sum-Product Networks**
by H. Zhao, T. Adel, G. Gordon and B. Amos, ICML 2016.

Along with some code to enable classification with missing data (see [here](https://github.com/HUJI-Deep/spn-opt-discrim/blob/master/test_model.cpp)).

The original README can be found [here](https://github.com/HUJI-Deep/spn-opt-discrim/blob/master/readme_original.md)
